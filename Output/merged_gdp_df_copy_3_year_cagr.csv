For this country, it is fiscal year-based (fiscal year-end: March 20). Also, an estimate (PA.NUS.ATLS) of the exchange rate covers the same period and thus differs from the official exchange rate (CY).

In addition, the World Bank systematically assesses the appropriateness of official exchange rates as conversion factors. In this country, multiple or dual exchange rate activity exists and must be accounted for appropriately in underlying statistics. An alternative estimate (“alternative conversion factor” - PA.NUS.ATLS) is thus calculated as a weighted average of the different exchange rates in use in the country.

In this country, multiple or dual exchange rate activity exists and must be accounted for appropriately in underlying statistics. An alternative estimate (“alternative conversion factor” - PA.NUS.ATLS) is thus calculated as a weighted average of the different exchange rates in use in the country. Doing so better reflects economic reality and leads to more accurate cross-country comparisons and country classifications by income level. For this country, this applies to the period 1971-2018. Alternative conversion factors are used in the Atlas methodology and elsewhere in World Development Indicators as single-year conversion factors.",Argentina,,,,,,,0.015499703248236685,0.15760655355929631,0.03792629139311021,-0.05059162167674891,-0.026220952840637524,0.08818333830984781,0.061092877114357735,0.02126721903267037,0.03218472188691335,0.16427579333971476,0.2776314855152058,-0.0006687898692593341,-0.10939727985454306,0.02687406206844578,0.043147285203078534,0.06842436133376939,0.0983547064630581,0.04344808436016767,0.030853008817794736,0.09740324049233684,-0.021061350837976334,-0.052608455858626835,0.11937954887217872,0.07911514539710329,0.04393371430684234,-0.11644524502688891,0.03849921220511199,0.3527734343519975,0.17411614717582724,0.07659923135561453,0.04011245169630384,0.029120158922390837,0.018694834455177167,0.043105740606398824,0.03180058842096489,-0.010741235122347148,-0.016717798707963083,-0.017743659982381477,-0.29942114919792406,-0.21984444935958403,0.18994583713101387,0.15919749677769723,0.12197245127879452,0.13101573854733206,0.15846482862375844,0.05012924275540964,0.054229631668436085,0.16770236841849306,0.08825723788229967,0.013560733423322091,-0.012151110185576908,0.025160013254682534,0.019388466444645314,0.026677303122219387,-0.019952514111572506,-0.11392949527782037,-0.09769571037900626,0.02856158685449195

In this country, multiple or dual exchange rate activity exists and must be accounted for appropriately in underlying statistics. An alternative estimate (“alternative conversion factor” - PA.NUS.ATLS) is thus calculated as a weighted average of the different exchange rates in use in the country. Doing so better reflects economic reality and leads to more accurate cross-country comparisons and country classifications by income level. For this country, this applies to the period 1983-2021.

The World Bank systematically assesses the appropriateness of official exchange rates as conversion factors. In this country, multiple or dual exchange rate activity exists and must be accounted for appropriately in underlying statistics. An alternative estimate (“alternative conversion factor” - PA.NUS.ATLS) is thus calculated as a weighted average of the different exchange rates in use in the country. Doing so better reflects economic reality and leads to more accurate cross-country comparisons and country classifications by income level. For this country, this applies to the period 1978-1993.

In this country, multiple or dual exchange rate activity exists and must be accounted for appropriately in underlying statistics. An alternative estimate (“alternative conversion factor” - PA.NUS.ATLS) is thus calculated as a weighted average of the different exchange rates in use in the country. Doing so better reflects economic reality and leads to more accurate cross-country comparisons and country classifications by income level. For this country, this applies to the period 1999-2004.

For this country, it is fiscal year-based (fiscal year-end: June 30) for the years 1980 and after. The data from 1973 to 1979 refer to the calendar year data. Also, an estimate (PA.NUS.ATLS) of the exchange rate covers the same period and thus differs from the official exchange rate (CY). 

In addition, the World Bank systematically assesses the appropriateness of official exchange rates as conversion factors. In this country, multiple or dual exchange rate activity exists and must be accounted for appropriately in underlying statistics. An alternative estimate (“alternative conversion factor” - PA.NUS.ATLS) is thus calculated as a weighted average of the different exchange rates in use in the country.

In this country, multiple or dual exchange rate activity exists and must be accounted for appropriately in underlying statistics. An alternative estimate (“alternative conversion factor” - PA.NUS.ATLS) is thus calculated as a weighted average of the different exchange rates in use in the country. Doing so better reflects economic reality and leads to more accurate cross-country comparisons and country classifications by income level. For this country, this applies to the period 1974-1987. Alternative conversion factors are used in the Atlas methodology and elsewhere in World Development Indicators as single-year conversion factors.",Ghana,,,,,0.04335585781112372,0.05755568829186575,0.07787179075962958,0.10047562722737857,0.07090537970473854,-0.05244816858399448,-0.07789676604557594,0.03949377428826417,0.09940009421565987,0.07200105706025539,-0.015705901462726324,0.0066285747504963854,0.11071327900239325,0.044575090008258655,-0.015101048173015386,0.04310983368231369,0.09819634351043405,0.08022095630232062,0.06669355710551006,0.016492844775844118,-0.03168015876607566,-0.013212592443059057,0.0301587715845002,0.035457570005782424,0.09086232775530201,0.04055100633034958,-0.03183353436998326,0.011489185143519709,0.04250261429095259,0.0789561500288849,0.028859207873097814,-0.03292144419322729,-0.05315218163171054,0.027129734564428798,0.08399568998678397,0.021506908622599186,0.02558292036548515,0.038547669598475,-0.12666997945897718,-0.11697777329886438,0.07360514976354149,0.12820632000280274,0.12932178634213543,0.12075477744792584,0.3203021317492589,0.3220521216366359,0.11948911390757844,0.01612168753445853,0.03932936808631382,0.1472978369910387,0.08628006470550975,0.16888401836683875,0.09900591412607862,-0.07695705831487443,0.00834116787998429,0.06929954040283581,0.062138392704175205,0.04197867780879472,0.013409999397386407,0.04325415975649505

In this country, multiple or dual exchange rate activity exists and must be accounted for appropriately in underlying statistics. An alternative estimate (“alternative conversion factor” - PA.NUS.ATLS) is thus calculated as a weighted average of the different exchange rates in use in the country. Doing so better reflects economic reality and leads to more accurate cross-country comparisons and country classifications by income level. For this country, this applies to the period 1985-2003.

In this country, multiple or dual exchange rate activity exists and must be accounted for appropriately in underlying statistics. An alternative estimate (“alternative conversion factor” - PA.NUS.ATLS) is thus calculated as a weighted average of the different exchange rates in use in the country. Doing so better reflects economic reality and leads to more accurate cross-country comparisons and country classifications by income level. For this country, this applies to the period 1988-1989.

For this country, it is fiscal year-based (fiscal year-end: March 20).  

The World Bank systematically assesses the appropriateness of official exchange rates as conversion factors. In this country, multiple or dual exchange rate activity exists and must be accounted for appropriately in underlying statistics. An alternative estimate (“alternative conversion factor” - PA.NUS.ATLS) is thus calculated as a weighted average of the different exchange rates in use in the country. Doing so better reflects economic reality and leads to more accurate cross-country comparisons and country classifications by income level. For this country, this applies to 1972-2021. Alternative conversion factors are used in the Atlas methodology and elsewhere in World Development Indicators as single-year conversion factors.","Iran, Islamic Rep.",,,,,0.03780174801813674,0.03643126271243724,0.046539478826541414,0.07934253378559086,0.08068389323881475,0.06827779799423506,0.08293007521208051,0.08846229853918852,0.08374947586320536,0.12118412708729998,0.16046667338192622,0.2540536752390137,0.39142095489228135,0.24113252056227186,0.13774471976363256,0.1589600008604919,0.04648661667464293,0.03895778370841119,0.06556140735719707,0.03596268219657439,0.10102903731251955,0.15875761958138201,0.08814661540849333,0.048396489856578295,0.08816701981837594,-0.09397469450774165,-0.16197803564810886,-0.03481223575620296,0.004731434129720435,,,,,0.14791297491709932,0.18783263408942097,0.05716840407011947,-0.02886111782300138,-0.00020779312598107058,-0.002074845577361817,0.03678358798807335,0.05483475182692299,0.06565176983493592,0.13895503538450105,0.1382740296836653,0.11902353181618808,0.15606382918286643,0.15689489852779293,0.059730247705604755,0.056903860781588156,0.14565274647920234,0.0977854721512681,-0.07673228054344872,-0.10586510369518487,-0.06082664879809607,-0.0017610560979515189,0.06032096689013233,-0.10195169090869582,-0.16456858946122077,-0.1025633866370157,0.08228494757292859

In this country, multiple or dual exchange rate activity exists and must be accounted for appropriately in underlying statistics. An alternative estimate (“alternative conversion factor” - PA.NUS.ATLS) is thus calculated as a weighted average of the different exchange rates in use in the country. Doing so better reflects economic reality and leads to more accurate cross-country comparisons and country classifications by income level. For this country, this applies to the period 1963-2004. Alternative conversion factors are used in the Atlas methodology and elsewhere in World Development Indicators as single-year conversion factors.",Cambodia,,,,,0.011817932639177409,0.042603610153113536,0.058553607271390806,0.0603383424581303,0.05309239012321254,0.03494857553409947,0.052413182736835706,0.005514181225416692,-0.12318342623145062,-0.003061104615953325,-0.11052815882763345,-0.10177118550831732,0.05191458134831173,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.10743158016570087,0.07900512417755046,0.00021380336344822837,-0.038154660215804936,0.007096411611523301,0.054029658457517504,0.042411095927531006,0.054451670112411366,0.053499595184124615,0.0760626341162618,0.1054679028337977,0.10870146103681533,0.11140275965798985,0.12478780510422971,0.06384521537654386,0.027884974465178125,0.07242472926450794,0.07725820592601695,0.05879163052910963,0.059229918494665856,0.05830576334643012,0.06219206142109002,0.07105113450102163,0.07073223694208175,0.06896667520464472,0.017346937826424602,-0.001581576696124798

In this country, multiple or dual exchange rate activity exists and must be accounted for appropriately in underlying statistics. An alternative estimate (“alternative conversion factor” - PA.NUS.ATLS) is thus calculated as a weighted average of the different exchange rates in use in the country.

For this country, it is fiscal year-based (fiscal year-end: September 30). Also, an estimate (PA.NUS.ATLS) of the exchange rate covers the same period and thus differs from the official exchange rate (CY). 	  

In addition, the World Bank systematically assesses the appropriateness of official exchange rates as conversion factors. In this country, multiple or dual exchange rate activity exists and must be accounted for appropriately in underlying statistics. An alternative estimate (“alternative conversion factor” - PA.NUS.ATLS) is thus calculated as a weighted average of the different exchange rates in use in the country. Doing so better reflects economic reality and leads to more accurate cross-country comparisons and country classifications by income level. For this country, this applies to the period 1960-2014. Alternative conversion factors are used in the Atlas methodology and elsewhere in World Development Indicators as single-year conversion factors.",Myanmar,,,,,,0.04140142228856125,-0.08113463332214432,-0.1518837617543911,-0.12548485506469054,-0.06587096018391458,0.18674375777262475,0.18880791792607154,0.029142175797604475,0.004812644113297626,0.03099979112412332,0.06042950029088767,0.1639415121347969,0.19155717659483762,0.04919106849972077,-0.03937875945712499,-0.07422033223367508,-0.02769217725094064,0.032958803386534896,0.050132267282850584,0.08831763932234282,0.10254772187738492,0.013131894738972694,-0.02795362228065057,0.054856915843612075,0.03372964573159076,-0.043256514494994014,0.049702983087921426,0.1350520637375041,0.084653521300879,0.028589719376437728,0.09549007520864561,0.19918075513353717,0.201975031629831,0.1465299910005684,0.04905230354815915,-0.07132162606938419,0.0006356070008806114,0.14082525094026077,0.03294867372348542,-0.037325333361338586,0.07626097268061338,0.15400135619296185,0.10940438869014724,0.0810107008252019,0.13766864007083313,0.24717138014701412,0.23621536573645452,0.179843227958294,0.22479019266305067,0.15554555977908935,0.0382670286081741,0.027507584071107205,0.013428230811121544,-0.015917127903588346,-0.008510134017401194,0.03653674700514675,0.03786689783005559,0.05538407761175934,-0.01781236749072579

Alternative conversion factors are used in the Atlas methodology and elsewhere in World Development Indicators as single-year conversion factors.",Nicaragua,,,,,0.05824390541816471,0.06789341739505161,0.0883195579489986,0.24593803145994486,0.21056168387122942,0.050707824217000486,0.046801710670539176,0.04408401641783932,0.03724380930063642,0.033868063678094584,0.042884849233299605,0.09779755622269093,0.1996854909737653,0.13298023036852213,0.06706372152727158,0.12090476697414987,0.050488416070555875,-0.11972090586334894,0.00729430292811406,0.1702010141013346,0.04034436009057041,0.03865745717764124,0.08001378724694597,-0.007285668080655117,-0.024172729398336035,0.12792860864655853,-0.030320945065562377,-0.359237617956469,-0.2733642122830737,0.13688439885953096,0.211011379041798,0.056654709180854246,0.29162931120175695,0.3308760207257391,0.03702338480973322,0.019695473183647838,0.024679078816605138,0.03418311574902466,0.03285578496758901,0.031109985845902743,0.00757104975367584,-4.331209925489965e-05,0.03520187048915546,0.0590072957633041,0.052823406308637244,0.055025569927940055,0.07902976402118989,0.037855926385944594,0.010162511841609101,0.05606907581626208,0.0633873683891839,0.03962821573581121,0.0409752291016352,0.05116962001282532,0.03797818129181829,0.026200660484081872,-0.006587585470241963,-0.029624740901606716,-0.011344102974738868,0.03615742100221686

In this country, multiple or dual exchange rate activity exists and must be accounted for appropriately in underlying statistics. An alternative estimate (“alternative conversion factor” - PA.NUS.ATLS) is thus calculated as a weighted average of the different exchange rates in use in the country. Doing so better reflects economic reality and leads to more accurate cross-country comparisons and country classifications by income level. For this country, this applies to the period 1988-2009.

In this country, multiple or dual exchange rate activity exists and must be accounted for appropriately in underlying statistics. An alternative estimate (“alternative conversion factor” - PA.NUS.ATLS) is thus calculated as a weighted average of the different exchange rates in use in the country. Doing so better reflects economic reality and leads to more accurate cross-country comparisons and country classifications by income level. For this country, this applies to the period 1982-1988.

In this country, multiple or dual exchange rate activity exists and must be accounted for appropriately in underlying statistics. An alternative estimate (“alternative conversion factor” - PA.NUS.ATLS) is thus calculated as a weighted average of the different exchange rates in use in the country. Doing so better reflects economic reality and leads to more accurate cross-country comparisons and country classifications by income level. For this country, this applies to the period 1987-1992. Alternative conversion factors are used in the Atlas methodology and elsewhere in World Development Indicators as single-year conversion factors.",Romania,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.031059326545862298,-0.015042511107026035,-0.11689169530597676,-0.1363359935195554,-0.03126512622145383,0.06181706911060236,0.12399093205471634,0.0709149437020089,-0.016847722546905475,0.041207855880259325,0.003528097050110146,-0.03684431978256408,0.0395955465699791,0.07334432427877946,0.12689555086776783,0.17627040218114232,0.19421843794498228,0.17628594724093372,0.21039270312652114,0.20652487809345565,-0.0009192130147355204,-0.07425618430455272,0.03425199449936889,0.017538537171816637,-0.00491122977358549,0.03691427624293442,-0.02136766921414701,-0.02468045004946029,0.0571348663193727,0.09507156270576811,0.061030333981804796,0.010902002164816293,0.04211448243976612

In this country, multiple or dual exchange rate activity exists and must be accounted for appropriately in underlying statistics. An alternative estimate (“alternative conversion factor” - PA.NUS.ATLS) is thus calculated as a weighted average of the different exchange rates in use in the country. Doing so better reflects economic reality and leads to more accurate cross-country comparisons and country classifications by income level. For this country, this applies to the period 2018-2020. Alternative conversion factors are used in the Atlas methodology and elsewhere in World Development Indicators as single-year conversion factors.",Sudan,,,,,0.0564964675768489,0.03383522052874266,0.014841697183922031,0.023056247449807277,0.022586281281803622,0.03569619640490518,0.041641657945945765,0.0474969042031923,0.0777333951244048,0.07393647110908708,0.05740141175762159,0.10377600830927003,0.16823580601817234,0.1615930131818306,0.14950132181477405,0.15849810946448595,0.031976745842488,0.0124160522848904,0.05283965000681512,0.035078644792821745,-0.02425866482442418,-0.06337879473324282,0.07903177008482953,-0.005733904769298137,-0.011470674781256629,0.143431256909768,0.12507821598749858,0.2096993357106236,0.3277386265157569,0.2703790337673935,-0.4064626484118685,-0.41290641767564484,0.22067199768952328,0.15905654110027756,-0.11004164054313026,-0.054717941377135815,0.07650094682696884,-0.02937382253946208,0.0289902856222104,0.13736635359513638,0.13951714507074242,0.10760588194898824,0.13680866204755726,0.18105514010059176,0.19319492487070322,0.19102076185092698,0.12722433984433423,-0.006343120563935711,0.0457865188487403,0.1036938308879789,-0.05189592045107938,-0.05566088411304593,0.06723378565358762,0.08778067605533679,0.1025003365522672,0.15138110115614278,-0.3202459325065561,-0.37063199852842343,-0.0579199915680263,0.020085496980513096

In this country, multiple or dual exchange rate activity exists and must be accounted for appropriately in underlying statistics. An alternative estimate (“alternative conversion factor” - PA.NUS.ATLS) is thus calculated as a weighted average of the different exchange rates in use in the country. Doing so better reflects economic reality and leads to more accurate cross-country comparisons and country classifications by income level. For this country, this applies to the period 1977-2017. Alternative conversion factors are used in the Atlas methodology and elsewhere in World Development Indicators as single-year conversion factors.",Somalia,,,,,0.040919748662680444,0.04089101908659809,0.04088379833828082,0.04084020059234361,0.0389039159916178,0.03698611976882771,0.0366448161571955,0.04072673552222472,0.04008699083307321,0.026230352180946603,0.0892742612506825,0.15262980153040173,0.03894481594110588,0.11921949259986486,0.19965434758871825,-0.11152790592533246,-0.11215204648813393,0.05799550914267426,0.022277349851753225,0.05794231834838848,0.08661940680599645,0.016319498679481015,0.00594227641546663,0.06093551333683278,0.05676580251694752,0.048356985366545535,0.03727955609176159,0.02655499120009286,-0.04054703094603429,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.05240887967305863,0.032684590140090064,0.016834654182897202,0.019030785676849904,0.04956219745418555,0.055339597585627676,0.05560207406980333

In this country, multiple or dual exchange rate activity exists and must be accounted for appropriately in underlying statistics. An alternative estimate (“alternative conversion factor” - PA.NUS.ATLS) is thus calculated as a weighted average of the different exchange rates in use in the country. Doing so better reflects economic reality and leads to more accurate cross-country comparisons and country classifications by income level. For this country, this applies to 1989-2021.

In this country, multiple or dual exchange rate activity exists and must be accounted for appropriately in underlying statistics. An alternative estimate (“alternative conversion factor” - PA.NUS.ATLS) is thus calculated as a weighted average of the different exchange rates in use in the country. Doing so better reflects economic reality and leads to more accurate cross-country comparisons and country classifications by income level. For this country, this applies to the period 2011-2017. Alternative conversion factors are used in the Atlas methodology and elsewhere in World Development Indicators as single-year conversion factors.",Syrian Arab Republic,,,,,0.08993908697052189,0.08292801126622562,0.06446693922353397,0.03471088134112921,-0.004572284217876588,0.027765514696506566,0.057462836812593565,0.07561317313793103,0.04446378928277106,0.05299678141978248,0.10713239288623222,0.07131904939586065,0.2067016552120986,0.2923237559766012,0.14774032032722695,0.07327324740008656,0.08741254253840536,0.12997123333041705,0.16543643861003288,0.19060132188075096,0.10293466924146744,0.03671375746293881,0.030800975038354883,0.043280408997235176,0.09872901522919508,0.15343369469365364,-0.1333261639429908,-0.1699304720528102,0.12983348215372437,0.14254984121710845,0.11467499074266718,0.09917116805177817,0.10843137423721072,0.11333179681829098,0.10930334436146416,0.09300860989417004,0.045909999081054975,0.03184614825925647,0.04600117588012287,0.059440603029522254,0.039639148883657827,0.033163896751811084,0.07615331141160864,0.119336176959012,0.10866817703032194,0.10287546086819166,0.12346566884667487,0.07645809668350068,0.05007147914093579,-0.3300016967802881,-0.44490836086275465,-0.3186716497945743,-0.2074416728152606,-0.0830586821610364,-0.16321149681923652,-0.002001256733140888,0.19225354471756595,0.11091742950667882,-0.1964130286029715,

For this country, it is fiscal year-based (fiscal year-end: June 30). Also, an estimate (PA.NUS.ATLS) of the exchange rate covers the same period and thus differs from the official exchange rate (CY). 	

In addition, the World Bank systematically assesses the appropriateness of official exchange rates as conversion factors. In this country, multiple or dual exchange rate activity exists and must be accounted for appropriately in underlying statistics. An alternative estimate (“alternative conversion factor” - PA.NUS.ATLS) is thus calculated as a weighted average of the different exchange rates in use in the country. Doing so better reflects economic reality and leads to more accurate cross-country comparisons and country classifications by income level. For this country, this applies to 1960-2009.

In this country, multiple or dual exchange rate activity exists and must be accounted for appropriately in underlying statistics. An alternative estimate (“alternative conversion factor” - PA.NUS.ATLS) is thus calculated as a weighted average of the different exchange rates in use in the country. Doing so better reflects economic reality and leads to more accurate cross-country comparisons and country classifications by income level. For this country, this applies to 1990-2019.
